# ♟️ Airdrop CheckMate

**The Strategic Command Center for Value Discovery on Base.**

🚀 Vision

In the Base ecosystem, thousands of users interact with high-quality protocols daily, yet significant value in the form of airdrops, grants, and creator rewards often remains unclaimed. **Airdrop CheckMate** is a professional-grade analytics dashboard designed to bridge this gap. 

By synchronizing multi-wallet onchain history with social identity (Farcaster & X), the platform provides a comprehensive "Checkmate Analysis" to ensure you never miss a value-distribution event again.
